## Technology Used
Python
## Futuer Improvements
I didn't notice about decorations to buttons, and I could not make thoes codes as like in my mind, so if possible I want to improve thoes codes as like using apps or regular websites.
## Licence
MIT-Licence
### reason:
I choes this licence because I am coding thoes codes for school assignment, and I don't really care about ownership. Also, I heard MIT licence could use with whatever reasons and Without hesitation, so I thought this licence will fit me best.
